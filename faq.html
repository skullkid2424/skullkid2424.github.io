<b>Q: What is this?</b>
<br><br>
A: This is a tool to help you build a Defense in the Aether Raids mode of the mobile game, Fire Emblem: Heroes.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Q: Where can I report bugs, make suggestions, or contribute code?</b>
<br><br>
A: You can <a href="https://github.com/skullkid2424/skullkid2424.github.io/issues">open an issue on Github</a> or reach out to me on reddit as <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/skullkid2424/">/u/skullkid2424</a>.  Feel free to open PRs against the github repo as well.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Q: Why is it so bad/bland/old looking?</b>
<br><br>
A: I don't do websites or make things pretty.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Q: Where are assets/icons from?</b>
<br><br>
A: From https://feheroes.gamepedia.com under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 3.0</a> License.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Q: Why are the coordinates like that?</b>
<br><br>
A: Its annoying for users to use (X,Y) coords in a game like this.  Also, the coords correspond with the <a href="https://vervefeh.github.io/FEH-AI/glossary.html#section1b">AI Tile Priority</a>.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Q: What features are planned?</b>
<br><br>
A: No promises, but I'm thinking about...

* Download Button - Click button, download the map.
* Reset Button - Nice and simply.  Clears the board (or perhaps goes back to the defaults)
* Error/Warning Box - Will show red/yellow warnings when you have things like two bolt towers, no fortress, etc.
* Export/Import - Will allow you to export the defense as a string, and then later import the string to load that defense.
* Offense characters - I may look at adding offense characters so specific game states can be recreated to share. Perhaps using teal boxes for defenders and red for attackers, with attackers flipped to face the other way.
